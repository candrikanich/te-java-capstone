Final Java Capstone Project - Meal Panner 5000

The Meal Planner 5000 is a meal planning application that answers the question posed in most households: "What do you want for dinner this week?" 

The Meal Planner 5000 allows users to create a library of household approve meals and recipes. And from that library of meals, create a 7-day meal plan. From that meal plan, you can also generate a shopping list of ingredients. 

Enjoy the Meal Planner 5000, and spend less time trying to decided what to eat, and just eat.
